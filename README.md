# OverTheWire Natas
My solutions to the [Natas](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) wargame on OverTheWire written in Python. The only external library that I have used is [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/). I wrote these in Python 3.6.

## Install Requests
I recommend using a virtual environment:

Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install requests
```

Or on Windows in PowerShell:
```powershell
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install requests
```

You may run into issues depending on how Python is installed in your environment. Check out the [Installing packages using pip and virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) guide.

When you're finished with your virtual environment, deactivate with the `deactivate` command.
